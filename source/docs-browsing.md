In this article we will show you a few examples why Pagehop is an awesome tool for navigation to documentation resources.

## Using a recipe

Pagehop comes with recipes that will help you find a reference for:
- **every css property or selector**;
- **every HTML element**;
- **every default JavaScript object or function**.

There is also a recipe for the API of the very popular JavaScript library, jQuery.

This is a pretty good reference for all the client side work in a web project.

And if you are a NodeJS developer, you are pretty well covered - Pagehop comes bundled-up with a recipe for searching the archive of npm (Node Package Manager) for packages.

We are pretty optimistic that soon the choice of recipes will be very rich.
We hope a community will emerge around the app and we count on **you**, our users, to help us get there.

So lets see some examples.

### Getting a reference for the `array.splice` function in JavaScript

Whenever you want to check a reference for anything browser related, the Mozilla Developer Network's website is a pretty good place to do it.

That's why Pagehop has a recipe for searching it.

Here is how we can find a reference for the commonly used (and sometimes confusing) splice function of JavaScript Array.

*Note: even just "m splice" would produce virtually the same results*

### Getting a reference for the `border` CSS property

Straight to the example:

*Note: even just "m border" would produce virtually the same results*

### Getting a reference for the HTML element `<div></div>`

## Navigating through static websites

Most often than not, online documentations are static websites, without too much content loading on demand.

Usually, they show close to no adds (and if there are some, they are in the form of images - banners).

**Pagehop is the ideal tool for navigation through such sites.**

If you have a hard time understanding how things work in the next examples and you haven't read the [Page-hopping](/page-hopping/) section - go do that before you continue.

Writing this documentation we tried many documentation sites and results were even better than expected. There wasn't a single site where Pagehop didn't made it through. Even websites with urls that redirect - links tool knows how to follow redirects and allows up to 6 consecutive redirects.

Lets see some awesome examples!
