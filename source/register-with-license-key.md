title: Register with License-key
---
Thanks for purchasing Pagehop and for being honest and fair. We will put *the minerals* to a good use.

## License-key

Once we process your order, we will send you an e-mail containing your license key.

It should look something like this:

{% raw %}
<figure class="highlight"><pre>========== BEGIN LICENSE ==========
John Doe
some@email.com
Quantity: 1
appVersion: 1
MGUCMFo1 euRqMtii VpNRcKCF XTrfnk9/
BWr0One8 T8ETu/wN KGuC+A4p x54xt8wr
8n9kNwIx AOnE2bD7 hoAkLtWo /fZpkggg
3GJ8k4Og xIvGengG 7gQJohee RwEt1qvj
l+4Li50R Ug
=========== END LICENSE ===========</pre></figure>
{% endraw %}

## Register with key

You need to copy the full text of your license, including the `== BEGIN LICENSE ==` and the `== END LICENSE ==` lines.

Then open the Registration form *(menuBarIcon)->Registration...*:

![](/register-with-license-key-resources/registration-menu-item.png)

If you haven't registered your (or another) key, you should see this window:

![](/register-with-license-key-resources/registration-window.png)

And here you paste your code in the big text area:

![](/register-with-license-key-resources/registration-window-paste.png)

After you press the `Unlock` button, if the key is accepted, you should get a screen like this:

![](/register-with-license-key-resources/registration-status-window.png)

## Switch owner of a machine

If Pagehop is registered on the machine that you use, but it's not your license, you can (permanently or just temporarily) deathorize the license-key and register with yours. This doesn't void the previous license-key. In fact you can switch between these accounts indefinitely.

This operation makes sense mostly when the previous user will no longer use the machine and **you** become the permanent user of this machine.

When you give your machine to someone else (selling or lending for a longer period of time), please, deathorize your license-key from the copy of Pagehop (`Deauthorize Account` button in the Registration window).

{% note warn You're not allowed to sell your License-key for Pagehop %}
