## I can't register my license key...

Please, try following the instructions in [this article](/register-with-license-key/).

## Pagehop doesn't open up anymore...

There are at least 2 possible causes:

### Shortcut isn't what you expect

Open the Pagehop Menu (from the MenuBar), and click Settings.

Is this the shortcut you expect?

**Solution:** Try resetting the shortcut.

## It only shows the spinning loading indicator...

First, check if you have an internet connection (you can do this in many different ways - in the browser loading a page or executing `ping google.com` on the terminal to check what % of the packages you sent get delivered to the other end - should be 100%).

If it's a connectivity issue, you should still be able toexecute the system recipes AllRecipes and AllTools to show you, accordingly, all recipes and all tools available in Pagehop - try `allr `.

If this happens for more than 1 min without any other indication, please try restarting the app - Pagehop Menu -> Quit and then start it, again.

If nothing changes, try logging out.

## WolframAlpha asks me to download an iPhone app?

Yeah. (:blushing:)
With WA recipe, we open up a page in the Pagehop result preview (right half of the screen) masking ourselves as a mobile browser. In fact we use an iPhone "user agent" to achieve this.

**But no worries!** All you need to do, is click on the link "continue..." at the bottom of the page and you probably will never see this message again. It's cached as a cookie to the webview.
