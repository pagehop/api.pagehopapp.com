# I can't register my license key...

Please, try following the instructions in [this article](/register-with-license-key/).

# Pagehop doesn't open up anymore...

There are at least 2 possible causes:

## Unclosed Registration window in the background

If you get the Registration window and then you âŒ¥ + Tab to some other window, the Registration window remains open in the background, which prevents Pagehop's main window (or any other window - Settings, About, too) to open up.

**Solution:** Open the Menu in the MenuBar and click on "Registration..." to get the Registration window to the front and then register your license key or click Cancel.

If you register Pagehop, you will never experience this behavior, again.

## Shortcut isn't what you expect

Open the Pagehop Menu (from the MenuBar), and click Settings.

Is this the shortcut you expect?

**Solution:** Try resetting the shortcut.

# It only shows the spinning loading indicator...

First, check if you have an internet connection (you can do this in many different ways - in the browser loading a page or executing `ping google.com` on the terminal to check what % of the packages you sent get delivered to the other end - should be 100%).

If it's a connectivity issue, you should still be able toexecute the system recipes AllRecipes and AllTools to show you, accordingly, all recipes and all tools available in Pagehop - try `allr `.

If this happens for more than 1 min without any other indication, please try restarting the app - Pagehop Menu -> Quit and then start it, again.

If nothing changes, try logging out.
